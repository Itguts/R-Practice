# Type of data and Measurement level
# Two types of data
#1 Categorical and 2. Numerical

#1. categorical:- describes categories/groups
#e.g:- species(human, wookie, droid)
#e.g:- Do u own  a car?-  Yes or NO(Groups)

#2. Numerical data:- Numbers(Discrete, Continous)
# Discrete:- can be counted in a finite way
#e.g:- Grade in IIT- 1000,1200,1250

# Continous:- Infinite and impossible to count
#e.g - Weight- a person weight- scale- 150 lbs or 68 kg- 0.1 variance


##### Types of variable###   (NOIR)
# It is determined by the scale it is recorded
#1 Nominal - Not numbers that cannot be meaningfully ordered
#e.g- species, weather(winter,spring, summer)
#2 Ordinal - consists or groups and categories in a strict order
#e.g- Feedback- poor, average, good
#3 Interval- Represented by number- no true zero
#e.g- temp in F or C- here 0 has meaning and can go below 0 , -5 degree celcius temp
#4 Ratio - represented in numbers, True Zero
#e.g- length- 0 inches- no length
