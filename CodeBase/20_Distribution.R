## Refrential Statistics
# It refers to the methods that  rely on the probability theory and distribution to
# predic population value baesd on sample data

# Distribution
#e.g:- Histogram shows frequency distribution
# Distribution is a function that  shows the possible values  for a variable  and how they often occur

#1. Normal Distribution(mean=median=mode)
#1.a Probability Distribution:- Most common observation will  be the most likely to occur,
#so they  will be at the center  of the distribution
# and reverse is:- the least common observation will be the least likely to occur and they lie in the tails of the distribution

# Standard Normal Distri:- Mean=0 and SD=1
# standardized variable or Z-score = (original variable-mean)/SD
# Z-score:- from probability table
#1. the probability of getting this score
#2. the probability of getting a score in the future
#3. whether scores of a specific size are likely for a distribution of a certain type
