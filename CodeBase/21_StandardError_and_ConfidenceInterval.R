##   Standard Error and Confidence interval
# SD:- Measure of variabilty
# We generaly do statistics on sample data and hope it is close to the actual data.

# Standard Error:- A measure of variability on a large scale

#Use case:-  How good a person is- a survey
#1. From entire population mean =6
#2 From different samples we get different means say x1 = 6, x2=5,x3=7,x4=8,x5=4,x6=6 like that
# Now we will focus on sample means, it shpuld be 6

# Standard Error = SD of sample means
#Case study fact:- If you have a sample more than 30 observations, you can accept that its coming from
# a sampling distribution with a mean equal to the population mean.

# Formula:- sigma/square root n
# SE:- It tells us how accurately the  population mean represents the sample means 
      # or it gives us the level of certaininty with which we can generalize from  a  sample to  a  population


# Other way to do this is by calculating Confidence Intervals:-
# Basically boundaries which we  believe designate a level of confidence.
# A range of values where the population mean is likely to fall(lower bounday, upper boundary)
# eg:- if mean of  sample is 8  then +2 and -2 may be the range of population mean.


# Recap:-
#1 SE:- 
#a. If large, our sample mean may be far from the true population mean
#b. If small, then a good estimation

#2. CI:-
#a:- If large, uninformative:- the true population mean can be anywhere in the range
#b:- If small, we can be fairly confident that for 95% of the cases, the sample mean is a decent estimate of the pop mean.
