###  Type I and II error:-

#1. Type I:- It is  the more serious error, it when you reject a true null hypothesis, It is alse called a False positive.
# When you  announe that  a null hypothesis is wrong and failed to prove it.
# The probability of this error is denoted as alpha

#2 Type II:-  It is when  you accept a false null. It means the Null hypothesis was wrong but you did not notice/catch and even  accepted the 
# null hypothesis.
# The probability of type II error is denoted as beta. It is determined from  sample
# The probability of rejecting false null hypothesis is 1-beta
